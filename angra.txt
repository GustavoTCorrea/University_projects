2. Spread Your Fire

[The crusader meets a Jewish Rabin; an old blind oracle with frightening looks who acknowledges that the voyager has been chosen by God to bring light to the eyes of people who can't see. He hands the crusader a book of blank pages eagerly shouting, "Spread your Fire! burn the temples down!".]

[The oracle's voice resounded in his ears lunatic and sensless for years.]

Woke up to life not long ago
You think your mind is in control?
God will take it back someday

It's not so hard to understand
They say the world has good and bad
Father Universe brings Love and Hate

Glorious - You'll lead the way
To free the world from these chains
Glorious - Your story now begins, Oh!
Fire!
Unleash the angel of the Light
Thank him for bringing us to life
Lucifer is just a name!

We are the only ones to blame
Just look around, I'm not insane!
Satan is a child of our God

Glorious - Don't be afraid
To lead the way with thy sword
Glorious - You are the chosen one. Go!

Spread your fire

Salve ara, salve victima
Spread your fire
De passionis gloria
Spread your fire
Qua vita mortem pertulit
Spread your fire
Et morte vitam reddidit

Glorious - Don't be afraid
To lead the way with thy sword
Glorious - You are the chosen one. Go!

Salve ara, salve victima
Spread your fire
De passionis gloria
Spread your fire
Qua vita mortem pertulit
Spread your fire
Et morte vitam reddidit


3. Angels And Demons

[Rumors come to the ears of the cardinals and the Pope. "A knight from the order of the temple has gone crazy and is claiming to be the new Jesus! Many of the peasants from the villages seem to be following the man." ...For threatening the catholic hegemony he is persecuted, captured, tortured, kept in prison, judged and sentenced to death. In front of the cardinals, the culprit humbly explains how Angels and Demons disguise, then he pronounses his famous Theory of Light based on the forgiveness of Satan, the absence of God, the Athiest Love and the Gnosis. "No absolute truth can exist in a conscious mind, because every single thought is submitted to an individual and arbitrary judgement."]

Dreams -- sensations you prove
Are taken from nature
You find those emotions are true in your mind

Fight against the kingdom of fear
Sooner or later they'll try to convince you are wrong
But I'm sure..
We're just

Crawling Angels and Demons disguised
The truth you don't know so try to be sure
When your Angels and Demons arise
Face the Truth: God is not love!
Feel as fluid as life,
Love is a rainbow
As much as it seems to be real
It's all in your mind

Sooner or later I'm gonna convince that
The truth is a lie
There's no Judge when we die
Only dust
We're just
Crawling Angels and Demons disguised
The truth you don't know so try to be sure
When your Angels and Demons arise
But we're still not sure which way we should go
When the Angels and Demons disguise
Just confusing our brains with their lies
Enticing emotions
Revoltiong devotions
The Angels and Demons telling me lies!


4. Waiting Silence

[The man falls in love with the young Muslim lady, and finds himself divided between the warmth and comfort of a humble life and his hunger for wisdom.. He is writing his dream and revelations on the empty book given by the Jewish oracle as his two sons are growing up . Four years have passed and his happiness seems to be a gift from God, waving deep into his heart. No other feeling could be greater than to hold and protect his beloved ones. Yet, he isn't complete. Should he share his knowledge and revelations? Would people care? And, as the great meanings of life are unveiling to his eyes, the Shadow Hunter is tormented by an extreme anxiety.. The urge for shouting reminds the moments prior to the troops' attack. A disturbing Waiting Silence, hovering seconds before the desperate screams.]

Caught in space and time
Like a bird in a cage
Cruelly confined
In a passing matters state

You suddenly realize
That the wrong is the right
Daring the laws
Ready to put up a fight
But...

Love will drag your heart away
To a world where dreams are made
Can't hide away
When your helpless mind obeys

Together we wait in silence
(Still are the cries)
Forever the fate is hungry
for your soul
Together we wait in silence
(Still are the cries)
Worth your while until you're gone

All the secrets of life reveal
To my eyes I can't conceal
And again I fly away
To a world where dreams are made

Together we wait in silence
(Still are the cries)
Forever the fate is hungry
for your soul
Together we wait in silence
(Still are the cries)
Worth your while until you're gone

Life's too short to grieve in sorrow
(Still are the cries)
Fate is waiting for your soul
(Secrets inside)
Live your life like no tomorrow
(Still are the cries)
Worth you're while until gone

Fate's gonna take your soul!


5. Wishing Well

[The crazy Rabin keeps appearing on his dreams. "It makes no difference if you throw your coins into the Wishing Well, or save your prayers inside a marvelous church filled of gold. All that matters is the faith inside you! If there is a God, He has no home; He is everywhere!"]

Close your eyes, what do you see?
Takes a while to believe
Feel the wind kissing your chin
Hold your cries make your wish
Dream away, breath...

Why did it take so long to understand?
Black sheep of the flock will soon be banned
Don't lose your hope, wish away

(Journey to the sacred ground of Dreamland)
To one's heart's content I'll be free again
(Visions telling secrets on the Dreamland)
And my fortune ends in the Wishing Well

Close your eyes what do you feel?
Hold your cries keep it still
Where am I? Why am I here?
Reasons where
Reasons why

(Journey to the sacred ground of Dreamland)
To one's heart's content I'll be free again
(Visions telling secrets on the Dreamland)
And my fortune ends in the Wishing Well

Oh! Who knows the truth in this world?

(Journey to the sacred ground of Dreamland)
To one's heart's content I'll be free again
(Visions telling secrets on the Dreamland)
And my fortune ends in the Wishing Well
Close your eyes, what do you see?
Make your dreams come true again
Where am I? Why am I here?
Dreaming is believing, your wishing well


6. The Temple Of Hate

[July of 1099, Jerusalem was stormed by the army of the Holy Roman Church; which atrociously annihilated every single inhabitant. The poor man's wife and two children were among the dea; cruelly killed by the insane Christian soldiers. "The entire population of the Holy city was put to the sword, Jews as well as Moslems, 70,000 men, women and children perished in a holocaust which raged for three days. In places men waded in bloodup to their ankles and horsemen were splashed by it as they rode through the streets. Weeping, these devout conquerors went barefoot to pray at the Holy Sepulcher before rushing eagerly back to the slaughter." - Desmond Sweard, The Monks of War.]

[The Reign of Jerusalem was founded upon the fanatic, intolerant and ignorant ideals of The Temple of Hate, against the will of those who lived in the Holy Land before their invasion.]

Nations battle on the field across the lands
Ruthless - stealing territories from our hands
Anger throwing down the victims to the ground
Cold blood younger soldiers weeping with no sound

Revolution striking down right now!

Blind fools fighting for the power to command
Flag poles threading down the freedom of our men
Innocence dying by the fury of the sword
Poor men falling before saying their last words

Revelation code XI
Striking over us

Sounds of revolution
Freedom is proclaimed

Bells announcing changes for the better
in the temple of hate
The Temple of Hate!
Satan awaits!

Revolution we have waited
Burning down our souls

Sounds of revolution
Freedom is proclaimed
Bells announcing changes for the better
in the temple of hate
Satan awaits!
The Temple of Hate!


7. The Shadow Hunter

[On a brothel-tavern, a gypsy prostitute sees in the eyes that he is the chosen one and reads him cards instead of giving him carnal pleasure. "The words of the old man won't have any sense until you find the morning star", says the prostitute. "Your mission is important, but it is not in the army". The voyager is desperately seeking for redemption to his mind and spirit, like a roaming wolf seeks for food. She fills him with doubts; saying that love will drag him out of his path.]

[...During the conquest of Xerigordon Fortress, The Shadow Hunter is injured and has to run away to escape from the troops of Kilij Arslan. Loosing blood, he collapses before getting back to Constantinople. He dreams about the lost scrolls hidden in the ruins of the Temple of Solomon and inside lost caves by the Dead Sea.]

I remember the blood on his hands
So ashamed regretting his faults
So defenseless he came from the darkness
We spoke and had a good talk

Dark old hat reminds me of someone
I find hard to recall
Bowed his head surrendering to sorrow
Wears the face of war
Desperate cries:

(Desperate cries)
Running in circles
(Mourining in vain)
Resigning to terror
(A sinful warfare)
A sinful warfare
(Innocents die)
Lost in the faith from my fragile heart...
...From my heart

Wearing black, a bow without arrows
God, have mercy on his soul
Eyes of dread, entrenched in horror
My devotions are gone!

(Desperate cries)
Running in circles
(Mourining in vain)
Resigning to terror
(A sinful warfare)
Atrocious attack
(Atrocious attack)
My crusaders faith
Drowns in religious blood
But I'll fight till the end
Gonna find my Holy Grail

Running blind against the faith
Reason slips away
Churches falling like castles on the sand
Ends the Holy War
Have the good for bad.

(What does a man gain from his work?
Under the sun where he labors

What is so good for a man in life?
During his days he's just like a shadow

Vanitas! Vanitas! Utters the oracle
A chasing after the wind

Meaningless! Meaningless searches for wisdom
Everything is in vain like your hunting for shadows)

Lost my pride, fought in vain
Had to find reasons to my pain - Oh!

Running blind against the faith
Running blind again
Church is falling like castles on the sand
Ends the Holy War
Jesus was a man

With a heart, with a mind
With a body, with a soul
So divine as your own

God has no mind, has no heart
Has no body, has no soul and no resemblance of you.

No!
(Like chasing the wind...)


8. No Pain For The Dead

[While he is burying his wife and children, the widower knows that he will have to carry that awful pain for life. All the great moments, they had together, vanished at once and converted into sad memories only. It is always better for those who leave than for those who stay. As he stares at his son's pale face in the coffin, he realizes how sublime it is to be free from the vain mortal feelings. Thus, there will be no pain for the dead.]

Standing by his coffin
Thoughts have gone astray
Life is just a burden
Carry yours away

Wipe the tears that fall
Moments recalled
In the child's eyes
Watch the world go by

Flying through the stars
Won't hide the scars

Always mourning cries
Wasted in this world
I'd never realized
Smiles in the falling rain
Wash the tears away

Face the angels of death
Soon your time will be over
Your salvation's ahead
That's why I said
There is no pain for the dead

Dying now
Hourglass counts down
Leaving this world
Your destination is

Hiding mourning time
Face up to the world
Another day passes by
Living our minutes in vain
Wipe the tears away

Triumph for the martyrs of the war
Fallen for the causes of the others
Worth the sacrifice?
Heroes are dying now
Hearing their mothers cry
Heaven is a metaphor
Free your mind and spirit

Mother Earth, do you partake my soul?
Oh, no!
Water, wind and fire will take our spirits away

(Victims of sacrifice)
Face the angel of death
(Struggling to survive)
Soon your time will be over

(Revolution remains)
Your salvation's ahead
It's not so sad
There is no pain for the dead

(Victims of sacrifice)
There'll be no rest 'til you're dead
(Struggling to survive)
Liberation of soul
It's not so sad
There is no pain for the dead

Oh!

No pain for the dead


9. Winds Of Destination

[In 1123, two noble men from Europe and seven Knights Crusaders were nominated to guard the ruins of the Temple of Solomon and to protect the Christians who came to visit the holy places. They were called Templar. Down the tunnels of the temple wreck they found relics and manuscripts which contained the essence of the secret traditions of Judaism and ancient Egypt, some of which probably went back to the day of Moses. Freedom of intellectual thought and the restoration of one and universal religion was their secret object. To the eyes of God, every life manifestation is the same. There is no special path prepared for us. A human being isn't worth more than a whirlwind carrying fallen leaves. We're all being carried by the same Winds of Destination.]

Blood is flowing on the ground
Like a river branching red lines
Anguish is all around
Hope yielding to despair

Life is a circumstance
Any minute slips away
God, please look upon us all
Do you give a damn?

Dancing in the air
Spinning leaves in circles giving
pleasure to my eyes
Sadden my delight
When the joy is over laying scattered
on the ground

Oh! The sun will rise
The beginning of creation
Oh! Into the skies
On the Winds of Destination
Carry us away...

Secret ark of Solomon
Hidden in the temple wreck...
for the king
Many years and centuries
Till seven knights from the order

Down the tunnels of the past
Learning from the undisclosed...
all the way!
Holding dreams on zealous hands
All those archives
Lost and wasted
Somewhere in the battle fields

Farewell to common world
Templars are watching
and guarding the scrolls
Shields of faith the knights behold
All Manuscripts of the sacred
laws are there

Dancing in the air
Spinning leaves in circles
Giving pleasure to my eyes

...arise!

Oh! The sun will rise
The beginning of creation
Oh! Into the skies
On the Winds of Destination
Carry us away

Old leaves will be falling
Old trees will remain
Whirlwind carries you away
For tomorrow be the same


10. Sprouts Of Time

[The Shadow Hunter starts a new religion, gathering people around him to spread the truth for him revealed. Words of peace and love sowed like seeds in the hearts of the wise; but fruitlessly dropped on the rocky soil of the hearts of the blind. 2The future is a consequence of what we do now. The present exposes the Sprouts of Time".]

I lay my eyes in the past
From the first day to the last
Several things we had to learn
Countless mistakes from times of yore

Now we restart, we recreate
Your present is your fate

Don't turn your backs on mankind!
Only yourselves you wanna save
Ignorance burns just like a fire
Consuming people on its flame

Fellow creatures, so wonderful!
So different and so grand

Sprouts of time
The roots evolving
The seeds for the future
were scattered yesterday
Tomorrow's harvest field we plant
today
Your crown will ever last
The tall trees of life

(Life experience)
Break your shell reach the light!
(Mind and sould)
Find your path to the skies
(Will come around on a thunder sound)
Raging with power and fury the new
born world

Sprouts of time
The roots evolving
The seeds from the past
branching out
Growing forever

Hands on heart
Embrace each other
The dances, the faces, the smiles
Behind the past

New seasons bring the chance
To start again
Tall trees will ever last
The circles of life


11. Morning Star

[When he wakes up, two Muslims men are carrying him away on a type of hammock hanging on a long piece of wood. Weak and frightened he can't react. Right above his head, while the sun is dawning, the Morning Star shines in the new day's sky. The six-points-shaped star presents a cross and the trident together as one. He understands the first sign as the wolves are howling. At that very moment, the first prophecy is accomplished. He will find out later, that the two men are brothers. They have decided to carry him to their house since they found him lying stained with blood on the ground.]

[... In the Muslim family house, their lovely sister Laura will take care of the crusader's wounds.]

Dawning time
Lights a new beginning
On the shadows of your eyes
Hurts inside
Wounded heart is healing
After all you will survive

All the time I was lost in the desert
Counting what was left from the
Illusions in my mind
Hopeless fights
Foolish thoughts we were in heaven
till we die, oh!
Death will bring us back
where we belong
Now you must decide before the
Dawn is brightening up the day
Announcing in the sky
the Morning Star

Nothing left to loose
I am going on my way tonight
(On my way and...)
Shouting to the moon
I'll be roaming till I find the Morning
Star - Oh!!!
Another chance you waste
I'm the owner of my days
I'll be howling through the night till
the end of time.

Look out!

All this time I was lost in the desert
Got to get away!
Now I must decide before the
Dawn is brightening up the day
Announcing in the sky
the Morning Star!

Nothing left to loose
I am going on my way tonight
(On my way and...)
Silent like the moon
I will wonder till I find the Morning
Star - Oh no!!!
Another chance you waste
Cause I'm going on my way tonight
(On my way and...)
Shouting to the stars
I'm the owner of my days
I'll be howling through the night till
the end of time. Oh!
End of time!
Shouting to the stars!


12. Late Redemption

[During the last moments on the life of this crusader, he is still questioning: "Was I right? Was I wrong?" Memories and thoughts twist his mind. The prisoner is being visited by angels. Or are they demons? Who knows? How can the purest heart judge evil? The Angel of Death stretches his arms and offers a comfortable eternal silence. The Shadow Hunter delivers his body and soul, sure of his Late Redemption.]

You wasted all your chances
To find yourself lost and lonely
Were so foolish
You were selfish
Much too blind to realzie
You messed up your own life...

Eu vou contando os dias
E já, já não tenho medo
Eu lhe peço
Eu imploro
Quando a minha hora chegar
Meu descanso minha paz

[ENGLISH TRANSLATION:]
I go on counting my days
And I'm not afraid anymore
I ask you, I beg you
When my time comes
My rest, my peace

Cante uma canção desconhecida
[TR.: Sing an unknown song]
Posioning with hope
the hearts around you
Plante mais lembranças na sua vida
[TR.: Plant more memories in your life]
Death is calling you
(Now or never!)
Nada além do amor é o que parece
[TR.: Nothing but love is what it seems]
Please the ones you love
before you miss'em
Toda a minha dor na minha prece.
[TR.: All my pain in my pray]
Win my chances back cause
Life is short but it's never late!

Tempo que passou
[TR.: Time that passed]
It's time to find Redemption
Não vai mais voltar
[TR.: Won't come back anymore]
Only love defies the Resurection
Tudo que se foi
[TR.: All that is gone]
Mark my words: God's abandoned this world!

Would I live again?
What's the new religion? Yeah!
And what shall be the bread?
Really I don't give a damn!
Never wanna live again
In this vain emotion
Over for me!

Sing a lullaby now I remember
Tempo que se foi e não se esquece mais
[TR.: Time that's gone won't be forgotten]
Memories are twisting in my mind
Win my chances back
Cause life is short but it's never late

It's time to find Redemption
Não vai mais voltar
[TR.: Won't come back anymore]

...tudo se acabou.
[TR.: ...Everything is over]

1. Evil Warning

[Matos, Bittencourt]

[INTRO]

Miles away
You're heading for the unknown
and there's no way to get back
Time to complain
Nobody is telling the truth

To live in the crowd
sick of my own vanity
Dead scattered petals around
Hymns of betrayal
calling you back for attack

Evil warning
Grown fast, too high
so sorry
Ends up the time
To cry and feel the pain
In the morning
start up the fight
so lonely...
with no fore-sight
until another day!

Run, don't wait the sun,
ride down the hill
Don't look behind
the evil crimes are chained
Until the end!

[SOLO]

[INTRO]

Evil warning
Grow fast, too high,
so sorry
ends up the time
to cry and feel the pain

Run, don't wait for the sun,
ride down the hill
Don't look behind
the evil crimes are chained
Until the end!

Don't let your pride
make your blood flow in vain
Until the end...


2. Time

[Matos, Bittencourt]

This time I wanna know
what life means...
...to live it again
looking forward, feel the
light into my eyes...
And now I know, my instincts
wasn't wrong,
and many things can be made
I don't believe now,
'Cause I'm dreaming alone

Oh, it's hard to find the love
that everyone's got,
but can't see (yeah)
Oh, beyond the flesh and blood
there's so much hidden behind
there's so much more we've gotta be

Sanity brings up the sadness
and keeps your illusions locked
in a little box
Fright comes, you find yourself lonely
in a cage of conclusions
crowding your mind

Love like they're bowing your head,
every answer - yes
Why do you trust me
and scream out your fears,
Running over
the tears you've contained
now cover up your eyes,
- Is that good for you?

And I will be here when fire burns!...

Welcome on board
over here is the ship of your life
So rotten
that will cast away
I'll be your sweet lullaby
all night
And if you fall
and never wake up...

And I'll be here when fire burns
(inside your heart)
Climb up the hills and mountains,
don't forget what you've learned!

Life make us feel
the time we cannot hold
Time make us live
a tale already told
Time make us heal
the feeling inside
the feeling inside of our hearts
and we steal away...

I'll be here when fire burns
(inside your heart)
Climb up the hills and mountains,
don't forget what you've learned!

Life make us feel
the time we cannot hold
Time make us live
a tale already told
Life make us heal [time make us heal]
the feeling inside
the feeling inside of our hearts
and we steal away


3. Reaching Horizons

Rainy clouds covered up the sunny sky
now I know I'll sleep alone tonight
tears and prays will be taken by the rain
And the loneliness in my dreams
And I know I'll never be the same living this tragedy, insane,
All I wanna be is to be free with you, with me
I don't blame the fate but it's too hard to face the truth
It was all just like paradise
just like we wanted to be
far beyond the reason
rest our lives
eternity denies the guilt of reality
senselessness
Fly high, reaching skies
to eagles trying to be free
moments of madness will be left behind
the same horizon but in different lands...


4. Carry On

Out for several times
Now you gave back
Nothing changed around
This world insists to be the same
Surely by our faults
The flowers fade along the way
Sight of blinding eyes
And now we just became the law
Of a non-sense life

Follow my steps and you'll be sent
To unknown ways you never went
Need nothing else than your own strength to be there

Now you have to face another day
You won't try alone
This living forces us to stay
For how long?
Cold is the night and fear rides
As a storm overflows
But can't you watch, I'm by your side
We'll be marching out!

Follow my steps and you'll be sent
To unknown ways you never went
Need nothing else than your own strength

So, carry on,
There's a meaning for life
Maybe someday we can find...
Carry on, it's time to forget
Remains of past, to carry on

Follow my steps and you'll be sent
To unknown ways you never went
Need nothing else than your own strength to be there

So, carry on,
There's a meaning for life
Maybe someday we can find...
Carry on, it's time to forget
Remains of past [2x]

Carry on, it's time to forget
Remains of past, to carry on

Remains of past, to carry on

Remains of past!


5. Queen Of The Night

Awaken the crystal bells of sorrow
Caught ourselves pretending our frustrations
Were gone
Once again, instead of facing the day
We ran away; closed our eyes
To keep leaning on feelings we had
We were close
Misty memories of a past come by
And I'll write my pray
On your face of hidden secrets
Never shared, freezing soul
Dreams last forever
To the empress of the dark
Lay down on eternity
Your music in the air
Great delight in the symphony
Our dance will never end
The Queen of the night
The master of wisdom
Pretending desires
With the grace of thunder
The Queen of the night
The feast of illusion
Pretending desires
With the grace of thunder


6. Angels Cry

[Matos, Bittencourt]

So, time is waiting
now overload
see weeping eyes
left me alone

Angels crying
Back to the war
Angels dying
resting (?) their fall

Try to wake, try to see
this future is not what you wished it to be
'cause everyday seems the same
to the whole mankind

So why you keep on standing on these fields
all your life
You sow the seeds that never grow
season won't end 'til the fine grain
harvest come
We're waiting for the down..
The change must come right now!

[SOLO]

Oh, stars are fading
seeds now may grown
begin of our lives

Angels crying
Back to the war
Angels dying
resting (?) their fall

Try to wake, try to see
this future is not what you wished it to be
'cause everyday seems the same
to the whole mankind

So why you keep on standing on these fields
all your life
You sow the seeds that never grow
season won't end 'til the fine grain
harvest come
We're waiting for the down..
change must come right now!

Angels are crying and dying
only change your..
nobody shits when glimpse
of your target lies behind you,
Like steps of the pilgrims
unshined!


7. Don't Despair

[Bonus Track]

Before the rays of light
Into a darkening bright
Awaked up quiet and once again
I try keep still, don't move
And reason can't improve
A purpose that fills up my veins

Into the light I'm running
Nobody turns to hear cries
Climbing the highest peaks of pain
A reason to stay

Can't stand the pressure pot
The Bibles that I've bought
They told me I'd be free someday
Maybe I'll just forget
And someway won't expect
This anger shadowing my nights

Into a nightmare falling
Somebody keeps me on high
Staring with kindness, no domain
A reason to stay

Waiting up for the sun
No matter if our lives
were drawing with no fun
Don't need you by my side to
stick together on the ropes
Why don't you get out my way,
I've gotta go!


8. Wuthering Heights

[Bonus Track]
[Kate Bush Cover]

Out on the wiley, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green
You had a temper, like my jealousy
Too hot, too greedy
How could you leave me?
When I needed to possess you
I hated you, I loved you too...
Bad dreams in the night,
They told me I was going to lose the fight
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering, wuthering heights
Heathcliff
It's me, Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window
Oh, it gets dark, it gets lonely
On the other side from you
I pine a lot, I find the lot
Falls through without you
I'm coming back, love
Cruel Heathcliff
My one dream, my only master...
Too long I roam the in night
I'm coming back to his side to put it right
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering, wuthering heights
Heathcliff
It's me, Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold
Let me in your window
Oh, let me have it
Let me grab away your soul away
Let me grab away your soul away
You know, it's me, Cathy...

1. Unfinished Allegro

[Instrumental]


2. Carry On

[Matos]

Simple minded brain,
For now you succumb
Nothing changes your way
This worlds insists to be the same
Based on our mistakes
The flowers fade along the road
Don't blindfold your eyes,
So loneliness becomes the law of a senseless life

Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride to get there...
Go!

Now you have to face another day
You won't be alone
This life is forcing us to stay - for how long?
Cold is the wind and thunder struck on a stormy night
But can't you see, I'm by your side
We are marching on!

Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride to get there...

So, carry on,
There's a meaning to life
Which someday we may find...
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past, to carry on

Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride to get there...

So, carry on,
There's a meaning to life
Which someday we may find...
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past

So, carry on,
There's a meaning to life
Which someday we may find...
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past

Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past, to carry on
The remains from the past, to carry on
The remains from the past...


3. Time

[Matos, Bittencourt]

This time I wanna know
what life means...
...to live it again
I'm looking forward, feel the
light shine in my eyes...
And now I know, my instincts
were not wrong,
and many things can be done
I don't believe now,
That I'm dreaming alone Oh, we're searching for the love
that everyone's got,
but can't see (yeah)
Oh, beyond the flesh and blood
there's so much hidden behind
as so much more we've gotta give... Sanity brings up the sadness
that keeps your illusions locked
in a little box
Fright comes, you find yourself lonely
in a cage of conclusions
crowding your mind
You sit back bowing your head,
every answer - yes
Why don't you trust me
and shed out your fears,
Running over
the tears you've contained
now cover up your eyes,
- Is it good for you?

I will be here when fire burns!...

Welcome on board
over here is the ship of your life
So rotten
that will cast away
I'll be your sweet lullaby
all the night
And if you get lost
you can hold my hand...

And I'll be here when fire burns
(inside your heart)
Climb up the hills and mountains,
don't forget what you've learned! Life make us feel
the time we cannot hold
Time make us live
a tale already told
Time make us heal
a feeling inside
a feeling that lies in your heart
that we stole away... And I'll be here when fire burns
(inside your heart)
Climb up the hills and mountains,
don't forget what you've learned! Life make us feel [life make
us feel]
the time we cannot hold
Time make us live (time make us live)
a tale already told
Time make us heal (time make us heal)
a feeling inside
a feeling that lies in your heart
that we stole away...


4. Angels Cry

[Matos, Bittencourt]

Cry in the night of the angel
For their light will never shine
With their hearts so full of sorrow
Muddy waters all around
The curtain falls
for helpless souls
How they suffer swept aside
And the raging streams are flowing
with so little hope inside

(Is like)
Angels crying
Can't take no more
Angels dying
capture their fall

Try to see this misery
your future is not what you wished it to be
So try to fly, the answer lies
in the angry darkened skies (angry darkened skies)

You just keep on standing in these fields
all your life
You sow the seeds that never grow
No harvest comes such a strain
to feed the few
Still you're waiting, it's in vain...
The change must come right now!

Oh, see the sun in the sky
(from the dawn of destruction)
Free, free this chain from my heart... (chain, chain, chain)
Hear the cry of angels
from this life you cannot hide
The change may come tomorrow
for the solemn weeping eyes

(Like)
Angels crying
Can't take no more
Angels dying
capture their fall

Try to see this misery
your future is not what you wished it to be
So try to fly, the answer lies
in the angry darkened skies (angry darkened skies)

You just keep on standing in these fields
all your life
You sow the seeds that never grow
No harvest comes such a strain
to feed the few
Still you're waiting, it's in vain...
The change must come right now!

Angels are crying and dying
There must be some way
endless you stray, still you pray
for a better life
Nobody sees when a glimpse
of your target lies behind you,
Like steps of the pilgrims
unshined!


5. Stand Away

[Bittencourt]

Stand away the dreaded burning fire
Will leave its mark for those with no desire
Stand in front of the whole creation
Face the people starved like worms
Still I'm begging for comprehension
From the ones who rules us all
In this field the dying embers soil
All around we mourn

Oh, here they come again
Now they're coming more aggressive
Tearing down our only chances
The stars can't find the purple sky
Loneliness will find its reason
treasured seed for every season
Long for the day be back someday
And the church
Church is selling consolation
killing Jesus for salvation
Don't let us die
Let me rest in peace

Away, a while
Our smile taken from
The hearts of broken souls Stand away from the fire
Destined by the fate
Let those sinners pay how they steal
For on the judgement day
How they yield Stand in front of the whole creation
Face the people starved like worms
Still I'm begging for comprehension
From the ones who rules us all On this field the dying embers
soil
All around we mourn

Oh, here they come again
(Now they're coming more aggressive
Tearing down our only chances)
The stars can't find the purple sky
(Loneliness will find its reason
treasured seed for every season)
Long for the day be back someday
And the church
(Church is selling consolation
killing Jesus for salvation]
Don't let us die
[Taking all in desperation
leave me now to rest in peace)
Rest in peace
Let me rest in peace...


6. Never Understand

[Matos, Bittencourt]

White gold, a morning came
Sunny cold, reflecting light
Unknown songs Fresh water gush licks the lime
Sprinkling crowns of silence
The face wet from the moistened dew Wind takes the sight
Around the meadow
Playing kindly Silver dropped wine
That flows inside
a sleeping hand... Desperation fills the air
(In your heart lies the dust of the anger)
Madness knocking on my back
(Chiming bells have announced the new day) My courage lies someplace
where time forgot to send me
(now where are you going?)
(now where are you going now?)
Someday they'll mark your sins
like torture on your back

I wonder why
My mind is tight
Like stormy weather
And so it seems
That little steps
would take forever Oh, never understand...
We're like mad horses
heading for the bend
This place I'm standing here
Made it on my own
Moored my life to never let it go... I wonder why
My mind is tight
Like stormy weather
And so it seems
That little steps
would take forever Never understand...
We're like mad horses
heading for the bend
This place I'm standing here
Made it on my own
Moored my life to never let it go... All my life I'll be the way
I won't forget
All my life is never understand


7. Wuthering Heights

[Kate Bush]

Out on the wiley, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green
You had a temper, like my jealousy
Too hot, too greedy
How could you leave me?
When I needed to possess you
I hated you, I loved you too...

Bad dreams in the night,
They told me I was going to loose the fight
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering,
Wuthering heights Heathcliff,
It's me, Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window Heathcliff,
It's me, Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window

Oh, it gets dark, it gets lonely
On the other side from you
I pine a lot, I find the lot
Falls through without you
I'm coming back, love
Cruel Heathcliff
My one dream, my only master...

Too long I roam in the night,
I'm coming back to his side to put it right
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering,
Wuthering heights Heathcliff,
It's me, Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window Heathcliff,
It's me, Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window

Oh, let me have it,
Let me grab away your soul
Oh, let me have it,
Let me grab away your soul You know it's me
You know [yeah]

Heathcliff,
It's me, Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window Heathcliff,
It's me, Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold
Let me in-a-your window Heathcliff,
It's me, Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold... Heathcliff,
It's me, Cathy
Come home, I'm so cold (yeah...)


8. Streets Of Tomorrow

[Matos]

Days of pounding emptiness
Just so far away, no regret
to live beside the danger Running out of carelessness
Still unlinked the tips of a bridge
That gets no one to nowhere

Let me run away
Freed from lies, I won't forget
Escaping from this chains
I'll meet my love
Once again flying
Clouds from heaven So, now?
Tell me how
To walk the streets of tomorrow
Someday, somehow
Then we'll know
How things went wrong And how?
Tell me now
To live in peace not forever
The moment remains
And flows...
Don't let it go!

How do you stay
Down and pray
Let me know
The things that you've done
on your own...
(Tell me right now, baby...) How do you stay
Down and pray
Let me know
The things that you've done
on your own...

Let me run away
Freed from lies, I won't forget
Escaping from this chains
I'll meet my love
Once again flying
Clouds from heaven So, now?
Tell me how
To walk the streets of tomorrow
Someday, somehow then
Then we'll know
How things went wrong And how?
Tell me now
To live in peace not forever
The moment remains
And flows...
Don't let it go!


9. Evil Warning

[Matos, Bittencourt]

Time to believe in the dream that you've seen
In a world that is broken and mean
One day the sun it will shine for us all
Take the freedom that you have fore-seen... Miles away
You're heading for the unknown
and there's no way to get back
Time to complain
Nobody is telling the truth To live in the crowd
sick of your own vanity
Dead scattered petals around
Hymns of betrayal
calling you for the attack

Evil warning
You're much too fast
and much too high,
No time to worry!
It's over,
no more remaining time
to cry and feel the pain...
In the morning
You stagger up
to start to fight
You get so lonely...
with no fore-sight
until another day! Run, don't wait for the sun,
cause it's setting on your hopes
Don't look far behind
for the shadows,
they will stand...
Until the end!

Time to believe in the dream that you've seen
In a world that is broken and mean
One day the sun it will shine for us all
Take the freedom that you have fore-seen... Time to believe in
the dream that you've seen
In a world that is broken and mean
One day the sun it will shine for us all
Take the freedom that you have fore-seen...

Evil warning
You're much too fast
and much too high,
No time to worry!
It's over,
no more remaining time
to cry and feel the pain... Run, don't wait for the sun,
cause it's setting on your hopes
Don't look far behind
for the shadows,
they still stand...
Until the end! And don't let your pride
make your blood
flow cold in vain...
Until the end...


10. Lasting Child

[Matos]

[I- The Parting Words]

Years gone by - Awake again
In a glowing star - That shines so far
Lasting child - Remains inside
Playing around - A future denied High overhead, dusk is insight.
..

Fumbling the mist
Lingering around... Blow,
Carrying winds
Take me high
Where I can see
The hidden lights
That blink far beyond... Blow,
Carrying winds
Take me high
Where I can see
The hidden lights
That blink far beyond... And then
A painted dream
Colours that melt
Inside slender frames
There I'll stand
There I belong...

ANGRA LYRICS

ANGRA LYRICS
album: "Freedom Call" (1996)
1. Freedom Call
2. Queen Of The Night
3. Reaching Horizons
4. Stand Away
5. Painkiller
6. Deep Blue
7. Angels Cry (Acoustic)
8. Never Understand (Acoustic)

1. Freedom Call

Slavery kings run free again
From their wounds a giant stands
Four hundred years of glory
Animals who speak and cry
Destiny of craving sights
Inside the dance of white domain

Wheels turning round will feed the ground
And women carry by their children with no life
To future days belong the past

But change the times
Now millions cry out
From away it comes...

Freedom call
Freedom overall to last forever

No disgrace
No more separate race
We'll keep together 'till the end


2. Queen Of The Night

Awaken by the crystal bells of sorrow
Caught ourselves pretending our frustrations
Were gone
Once again, instead of facing the day
We ran away; closed our eyes
To keep leaning on feelings we had
We were close
Misty memories of a past come by
And I'll write my pray
On your face of hidden secrets
Never shared, freezing soul
Dreams last forever
To the empress of the dark
Lay down on eternity
Your music in the air
Great delight in the symphony
Our dance will never end
The Queen of the night
The master of wisdom
Pretending desires
With the grace of thunder
The Queen of the night
The feast of illusion
Pretending desires
With the grace of thunder


3. Reaching Horizons

Rainy clouds covered up the sunny sky
now I know I'll sleep alone tonight
tears and prays will be taken by the rain
And the loneliness in my dreams
And I know I'll never be the same living this tragedy, insane,
All I wanna be is to be free with you, with me
I don't blame the fate but it's too hard to face the truth
It was all just like paradise
just like we wanted to be
far beyond the reason
rest our lives
eternity denies the guilt of reality
senselessness
Fly high, reaching skies
to eagles trying to be free
moments of madness will be left behind
the same horizon but in different lands...


4. Stand Away

Stand away the dreaded burning fire
Will leave its mark for those with no desire
Stand in front of the whole creation
Face the people starved like worms
Still I'm begging for comprehension
From the ones who rules us all

In this field the dying embers soil
All around we mourn

Oh, here they come again
Now they're coming more aggressive
Tearing down our only chances
The stars can't find the purple sky
Loneliness will find its reason
treasured seed for every season
Long for the day be back someday
And the church
Church is selling consolation
killing Jesus for salvation
Don't let us die
Let me rest in peace

Away, a while
Our smile taken from
The hearts of broken souls

Stand away from the fire
Destined by the fate
Let those sinners pay how they steal
For on the judgement day
How they yield

Stand in front of the whole creation
Face the people starved like worms
Still I'm begging for comprehension
From the ones who rules us all

On this field the dying embers soil
All around we mourn

Oh, here they come again
[Now they're coming more aggressive
Tearing down our only chances]
The stars can't find the purple sky
[Loneliness will find its reason
treasured seed for every season]
Long for the day be back someday
And the church
[Church is selling consolation
killing Jesus for salvation]
Don't let us die
[Taking all in desperation
leave me now to rest in peace]
Rest in peace
Let me rest in peace...


5. Painkiller

[Judas Priest cover]

Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine

Rides the Metal Monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller

Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas

Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts fo steel
Evils going under deadly wheels

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller

Faster than a lazer bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns

Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured
They've been brought back from the grave

With mankind resurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies

He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Wings of steel Painkiller
Deadly wheels Painkiller


6. Deep Blue

Three cliffs there stand
High above where high winds howl
Surrounding silence
Three birds climb, then turn to fall

Waiting for someday when the ocean and sky
Will cover up the land in deep blue
Renaissance is over and I wonder:
- Should I always be the same once again?

Take my hand and follow
Sweeping trees, the coats of green
Time has no place tomorrow
Feel the good in endless dreams

Waiting for someday when the ocean and sky
Will cover up the land in deep blue
Renaissance is over and I wonder:
- Should I close my eyes and pray?
- Always be the same?

Waiting for someday when the ocean and sky
Will cover up the land in deep blue
Renaissance is over and I wonder:
- Should I close my eyes and pray?
- Feel like I've betrayed?
- Always be the same?


7. Angels Cry (Acoustic)

[Bonus Track]

Cry in the night of the angel
For their light will never shine
With their hearts so full of sorrow
Muddy waters all around
The curtain falls for helpless souls
How they suffer swept aside
And the raging streams are flowing
with so little hope inside

Angels crying
Can't take no more
Angels dying
Capture their fall

Try to see this misery
your future is not what you wished it to be
So try to fly, the answer lies
in the angry darkened skies

You just keep on standing in these fields all your life
You sow the seeds that never grow
No harvest comes such a strain to feed the few
Still you're waiting, it's in vain...
The change must come right now!

Oh, see the sun in the sky
Free, free this chain from my heart...
Hear the cry of angels
from this life you cannot hide
The change may come tomorrow
for the solemn weeping eyes

Angels crying
Can't take no more
Angels dying
Capture their fall

Try to see this misery
your future is not what you wished it to be
So try to fly, the answer lies
in the angry darkened skies

You just keep on standing in these fields all your life
You sow the seeds that never grow
No harvest comes such a strain to feed the few
Still you're waiting, it's in vain...
The change must come right now!

Angels are crying and dying
There must be some way
endless you stray, still you pray for a better life
Nobody sees when a glimpse
of your target lies behind you,
Like steps of the pilgrims unshined!


8. Never Understand (Acoustic)

[Bonus Track]

White gold, a morning came
Sunny cold, reflecting light
Unknown songs

Fresh water gush licks the line
Sprinkling crowns of silence
The face wet from the moistened dew

Wind takes the sight
Around the meadow
Playing kindly
Silver dropped wine
That flows inside, a sleeping hand...

Desperation fills the air
(In your heart lies the dust of the anger)
Madness knocking on my back
(Chiming bells have announced the new day)

My courage lies someplace
where time forgot to send me
(now where are you going?)
(now where are you going now?)
Someday they'll mark your sins
Like torture on your back

I wonder why
My mind is tight
Like stormy weather
And so it seems
That little steps
Would take forever

Oh, never understand
We're like mad horses heading for the bend
This place I'm standing here
Made it on my own
Moored my life to never let it go...

I wonder why
My mind is tight
Like stormy weather
And so it seems
That little steps
Would take forever

Oh, never understand
We're like mad horses heading for the bend
This place I'm standing here
Made it on my own
Moored my life to never let it go...

All my life I bleed away
I won't forget
All my life is never understand

[Originally written by G.P. da Palestrina (1525-1594)]


2. Nothing To Say

Long ago, the same sky above;
"It's lonesome when the sun goes down";
A day had come when we were like one:
- Weapons up, never surrender!

Oh, I saw the gleams of gold
We'd kill and die conquering a virgin world
The hold corrupted by the honour

Living forevermore, leaving today
Back to my place, I've got
Nothing to say!

Guilt and shame, it's all so insane
Pagan gods die with no defence
And we could go no further at all
Digging the graves of our conscience

Oh, the sounds, they still echoe
All of us drifting on seas of blood
The hope hidden behind the horror

Living forevermore, leaving today
Back from this land, I've got
Nothing to say!
Living forevermore, leaving today;
For all what remains I've got
Nothing to say!

Oh, how many years have gone
Every morning I bare myself from love
The love rising up from the sorrow

Living forevermore, leaving today
For all what remains I've got
Nothing to say!

Living forevermore - Nothing to say!
Back to my place, I've got...
Living forevermore - Nothing to say!
For all what remains, I've got
Nothing to say!


3. Silence & Distance

Been here for so long
On the morrow I'll dare
Silent and distant
Reaching out, unaware
Stealing the whispers
From my deepest request

And you watch me
Waiting for something new
My hands, as empty
As my body and soul
Could keep pretending
But in the heart I'd be gone...

Still stare at my face
But lost seem your eyes
Keep hold of the sails
Against the blue sky

Ooh, I'm intending
A way back to the sea
This emptiness burns inside
And leads on for endless miles

Don't let me go
Away across the sea,
It may be much more wide
Than what it seems to be

Ooh, I'm still searching
The way back to be freed
The loneliness hangs around us
However we can't see

Now let me go
Away across the sea,
The waves can't be as high
As they pretend to be

And now I know
In my heart, I won't forget
The sails against the blue sky
That taught me how to live

... with no sorrow
And tomorrow we'll share
Silence and distance
'till our faults are repaired
You'll be the mistress
Who I'll never forget.


4. Carolina IV

"Salve, salve, Iemanjá, salve, Janaína
E tudo o que se fez n'água
Joguem flores para o mar, Deus salve a Rainha
E o meu passo nessa esfera"

All I see floats with the wind
All the miracles of the water
Are the miracles never seen

Somehow my life now begins
This music that's been played through time
Now starts to reach my feet

Feels like the flood of my needs
From the harmony of forever
Sound the melodies of the sea

And you will know on the way
I'm coming back to my enemies
I'm turning around
I'll be just coming back to my last days
I'm coming back to the sea!

So... won't you come with me, my friend?
Thrills... like we had before
Hope... never showing up the same
For a lonely man

"Salve, salve, Iemanjá, salve, Janaína
E tudo o que se fez n'água
Joguem flores para o mar, Deus salve a Rainha
E o meu passo nessa esfera"

Since the day we left the land
We've been anxious on approach
Captain kept showing his plans:
"Under sail we go!"

Deep the ocean's blue I stare
The reflections of my soul
We have with us a special guest
And for him we made a toast

Carolina IV took a river to the sky
Seven men on board taking part
To take their hearts around
All around, around the world!

All I can recall that day
On that very day for sure
All hands up against the haze
As we attempted the return

Carolina IV took the river to the sky
One man less on board - human dreams
Have sometimes cost their lives,
All their lives dreaming

I've been such a fool
(I've been such a fool)
I've been so afraid
(I've been so afraid)
From my heart to you I say:
I'll be here to stay!

Nothing much left from the boat
Many years have been and gone
Still I can't forget the past
And the ones I left at home

Carolina IV took the river to the sky
Windy whistling nights
Made me sail right into the wind's eye
Now I'll die singing:

I've been such a fool
(I've been such a fool)
I've been so afraid
(I've been so afraid)
From my heart to you I say:
I'll be here to stay!

I've been such a fool
(I've been such a fool)
I've been so afraid
(I've been so afraid)
From my heart to you I say:
I'll be here to stay!

Salve, salve, Iemanjá, salve, Janaína E tudo o que se fez n'água
All I see floats with the wind
(Joguem flores para o mar, Deus salve a Rainha)
(E o meu passo nessa esfera)
Somehow my life now begins
(Um caboclo de orixás logo deixa a Terra)
(Vai de encontro à sua sina)
Feels like the flood of my needs
(Onde o céu encontra o mar achará seu porto)
(E é assim que isso termina)
All I see floats in the, floats with the wind
(Salve, salve, Iemanjá, salve, Janaína)
(E tudo o que se fez n'água)
Joguem flores para o mar,
Deus salve a Rainha E o meu passo nessa esfera
Um caboclo de orixás logo deixa a Terra
Vai de encontro à sua sina
Onde o céu encontra o mar achará seu porto
E é assim que isso termina
Salve, salve, Iemanjá, salve, Janaína
E tudo o que se fez n'água
Joguem flores para o mar, Deus salve a Rainha
E o meu passo nessa esfera
Um caboclo de orixás logo deixa a Terra
Vai de encontro à sua sina


5. Holy Land

We were born in a Golden Age
Beyond the creed
Blown with the winds to meet
The ones who creep
And pray
Unshold feet traces on fresh sand
A map unfold
Spreading out knowledge,
Magic and love
And then ... ooh, and then,

Carried by wooden gods
We leave toward the sky
Gushed out the holy blood
From those who die
To bless

Ooh, and dance...
Ooh, still dance... Someone has sent
Somebody here
To bring an age
Long disappeared

Holy Land - Throw your scars on me!
My soul just tends to be
Your friend Holy Land - Holy Land around
Holy Land - Holy Land is all...

Someone has sent
Somebody here
To bring an age
Long disappeared

Holy Land - Show your signs to me!
'cause I'm still here to see
Your face Holy Land - Holy Land around
Holy Land - Holy Land is all...
Holy Land, Holy Land...


6. The Shaman

Oh boys, I've seen the old man;
Straw mask around the forehead
The blaze, a blast and the awakening dead
(The magic seeds will spread...)

The bleeding warrior, he has fought
(Healing leaves, piranha teeth, nobody leaves this place 'till
the dawn!)
Against the passion, for the love
(Serpent skin, a savage scream, don't you believe, it grows and
grows...)

Oh boys, it's all so easy:
Warn up the soul
While the body is freezin'!...
- I swear it!

Against the men for the land,
Against the beast to survive
Against the demons to keep the faith
(The spirits and the fate...)

A word - together they will shout!
(Run and pray if you're afraid you better stay away from it all!)

A rumble shakes up all the ground
(Start to sing, to turn and spin, get rid of all your sins right
now!...)

Oh boys, it's all so easy:
Warm up the soul
While the body is freezin'!

A word - together they will shout!
(Healing leaves, piranha teeth, nobody leaves this place 'till
the dawn!)
Against the passion, for the love
(Start to sing, to turn and spin, get rid of all your sins right
now!...)

Oh boys, it's all so easy:
Warm up the soul
While the body is freezin'!
Still we can hope a single word together;
Warm up the soul...

- Boys, I swear I've been there!


7. Make Believe

Sat beside the meadow
Watching weeds agrow
Cleaned up all the ashes
Of my soul

Wrote down my own sentence
Now you take your way
Fades the last remembrance
Of your lovely pretty face

I, after all,
Just a lonely man - a lonely heart! Working on the future
Floating on fate
Faced the circunstances
Cleared up the shades, so

Make believe
There's no sorrow in your eyes
Can't you see
We could never get back from the start
Minutes waiting, life's been wasted
... maybe I wanna die some other day
Hear the whispers of your hope
The answer wasn't told
No, don't laugh seeing me cry
The end I've left behind
(... the whispers of your hope are left behind!)

Make believe
There's no sorrow in your eyes
Can't you see
We could never get back from the start
Minutes waiting, life's been wasted

And I've tried,
Maybe you deny
Words of peace
For the future of our lives
Bring to me
Something else than a broken heart
I won't wait 'till my life is wasted
... maybe I wanna die some other day


8. Z.I.T.O.

Somehow I turn around and see
My nerves break down inside
Maybe you might know much more than me
So tell me what is right to say

Down the weakness of my soul
Lie the secrets, and I know
There's something pushing back
Wish my hands could turn to gold
And my heart would break the cold
To give my thoughts some sense

The turn is close, new century
Still people think they're kings
Now you've got your voice,
Your own speech
Don't wait 'till someone else agress

Swimming naked of beliefs
And responsabilities
Just feel the sea of bliss
Mother nature brings to me
In fantastic purity
Everything I need

Like a teenager discovery
What's more delightful than this?
Try to remember how good it was
Feeling the life as it is
To believe!

New world was born out of man's dreams
Now we walk on our own
The angels cried, you've heard them weep
But now it's time to make them sing!

Swimming naked of beliefs
And responsabilities
Just feel the sea of bliss
Mother nature brings to me
In fantastic purity
Everything I need

Like a teenager discovery
What's more delightful than this?
Try to remember how good it was
Feeling the life as it is
To believe!


9. Deep Blue

Three cliffs there stand
High above where high winds howl
Surrounding silence
Three birds climb, then turn to fall

Waiting for someday when the ocean and sky
Will cover up the land in deep blue
Renaissance is over and I wonder:
- Should I always be the same once again?

Take my hand and follow
Sweeping trees, the coats of green
Time has no place tomorrow
Feel the good in endless dreams

Waiting for someday when the ocean and sky
Will cover up the land in deep blue
Renaissance is over and I wonder:
- Should I close my eyes and pray?
- Feel like I've betrayed?
- Always be the same?

... always be the same once again?


10. Lullaby For Lucifer

On the sand, by the sea
I left my heart to shed my grief
A vulture came begging me:
- Feed me with this piece of meat!

I won't give away
Something I need

On a garden nursery
I let my fancy wander free
Children playing around a tree
Sharing apples happily

Come and rest with me
Lay your hands on dreams

I'll wait here by your side
'till you fall asleep
I'll wait until you cry
All over me the tears you hide inside...


11. Queen Of The Night

[Japanese and French Bonus Track]

Awaken by the crystal bell of sorrow
Caught ourselves pretending our frustations
Were gone
Once again, instead of facing the day
We ran away; closed our eyes
To keep leaning on feelings we had

We were close
Misty memories of a past come by
And I'll write my pray
On your face of hidden secrets
Never shared, freezing soul

Dreams last forever
To the empress of the dark
Lay down on eternity
Your music in the air
Great delight in the symphony
Our dance will never end

The Queen of the Night
The master of evil
Pretending desires
With the grace of thunder

The Queen of the Night
The feast of illusion
Pretending desires
With the grace of thunder

7. The Shaman

13. Wasted Years

1. Angels Cry

Cry in the night of the angel
For their light will never shine
With their hearts so full of sorrow
Muddy waters all around
The curtain falls
for helpless souls
How they suffer swept aside
And the raging streams are flowing
with so little hope inside

(Is like)
Angels crying
Can't take no more
Angels dying
capture their fall

Try to see this misery
your future is not what you wished it to be
So try to fly, the answer lies
in the angry darkened skies (angry darkened skies)

You just keep on standing in these fields
all your life
You sow the seeds that never grow
No harvest comes such a strain
to feed the few
Still you're waiting, it's in vain...
The change must come right now!

Oh, see the sun in the sky
(from the dawn of destruction)
Free, free this chain from my heart... (chain, chain, chain)
Hear the cry of angels
from this life you cannot hide
The change may come tomorrow
for the solemn weeping eyes

(Like)
Angels crying
Can't take no more
Angels dying
capture their fall

Try to see this misery
your future is not what you wished it to be
So try to fly, the answer lies
in the angry darkened skies (angry darkened skies)

You just keep on standing in these fields
all your life
You sow the seeds that never grow
No harvest comes such a strain
to feed the few
Still you're waiting, it's in vain...
The change must come right now!

Angels are crying and dying
There must be some way
endless you stray, still you pray
for a better life
Nobody sees when a glimpse
of your target lies behind you,
Like steps of the pilgrims unshined!


2. Time

This time I wanna know
what life means...
...to live it again
I'm looking forward, feel the
light shine in my eyes...
And now I know, my instincts
were not wrong,
and many things can be done
I don't believe now,
That I'm dreaming alone

Oh, we're searching for the love
that everyone's got,
but can't see (yeah)
Oh, beyond the flesh and blood
there's so much hidden behind
as so much more we've gotta give...

Sanity brings up the sadness
that keeps your illusions locked
in a little box
Fright comes, you find yourself lonely
in a cage of conclusions
crowding your mind
You sit back bowing your head,
every answer - yes
Why don't you trust me
and shed out your fears,
Running over
the tears you've contained
now cover up your eyes,
- Is it good for you?

I will be here when fire burns!...

Welcome on board
over here is the ship of your life
So rotten
that will cast away
I'll be your sweet lullaby
all the night
And if you get lost
you can hold my hand...

And I'll be here when fire burns
[inside your heart]
Climb up the hills and mountains,
don't forget what you've learned!

Life make us feel
the time we cannot hold
Time make us live
a tale already told
Time make us heal
a feeling inside
a feeling that lies in your heart
that we stole away...

And I'll be here when fire burns
[inside your heart]
Climb up the hills and mountains,
don't forget what you've learned!

Life make us feel [life make us feel]
the time we cannot hold
Time make us live [time make us live]
a tale already told
Time make us heal (time make us heal)
a feeling inside
a feeling that lies in your heart
that we stole away...


3. Make Believe

Watching weeds agrow
Cleaned up all the ashes
Of my soul

Wrote down my own sentence
Now you take your way
Fades the last remembrance
Of your lovely pretty face

I, after all,
Just a lonely man - a lonely heart!

And I've tried,
Maybe you deny.
Words of peace
For the future of our lives

Bring to me
Something else than a broken heart
I won't wait 'till my life is wasted
...Maybe I wanna die some other day


4. Carry On

[Matos]

Simple minded brain,
For now you succumb
Nothing changes your way
This worlds insists to be the same
Based on our mistakes
The flowers fade along the road
Don't blindfold your eyes,
So loneliness becomes the law of a senseless life

Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride to get there...
Go!

Now you have to face another day
You won't be alone
This life is forcing us to stay - for how long?
Cold is the wind and thunder struck on a stormy night
But can't you see, I'm by your side
We are marching on!

Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride to get there...

So, carry on,
There's a meaning to life
Which someday we may find...
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past, to carry on

Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride to get there...

So, carry on,
There's a meaning to life
Which someday we may find...
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past

So, carry on,
There's a meaning to life
Which someday we may find...
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past

Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past, to carry on
The remains from the past, to carry on
The remains from the past...


5. Lullaby For Lucifer

On the sand, by the sea
I left my heart to shed my grief
A vulture came begging me:
- Feed me with this piece of meat!

I won't give away
Something I need

On a garden nursery
I let my face wander free
Children playing around a tree
Sharing apples happily

Come and rest with me
Lay your hands on dreams

I'll wait here by your side
Till you fall asleep
I'll wait until you cry
All over me the tears you hide inside...


6. Reaching Horizons

Rainy clouds covered up the sunny sky
now I know I'll sleep alone tonight
tears and prays will be taken by the rain
And the loneliness in my dreams
And I know I'll never be the same living this tragedy, insane,
All I wanna be is to be free with you, with me
I don't blame the fate but it's too hard to face the truth
It was all just like paradise
just like we wanted to be
far beyond the reason
rest our lives
eternity denies the guilt of reality
senselessness
Fly high, reaching skies
to eagles trying to be free
moments of madness will be left behind
the same horizon but in different lands...


7. The Shaman

Oh boys, I've seen the old man;
Straw mask around the forehead
The blaze, a blast and the awakening dead
(The magic seeds will spread...)

The bleeding warrior, he has fought -
(Healing leaves, piranha teeth,
nobody leaves this place 'till the dawn!)
Against the passion, for the love
(Serpent skin, a savage scream,
don't you believe, it grows and grows...)

Oh boys, it's all so easy:
Warm up the soul
While the body is freezing''!
- I swear it!

Against the men for the land
Against the beast to survive
Against the demons to keep the faith
(The spirits and the fate...)

A word - together they will shout!
(Run and pray if you're afraid
you better stay away from it all!)
A rumble shakes up all the ground
(Start to sing, to turn and spin,
get rid of all your sins right now!..)

Oh boys, it's all so easy:
Warm up the soul
While the body is freezin'!

A word - together they will shout!
(Healing leaves, piranha teeth,
nobody leaves this place 'till the dawn!)
Against the passion, for the love
(Start to sing, to turn and spin,
get rid of all your sins right now!..)

Oh boys, it's all so easy:
Warm up the soul
While the body is freezin'!
Still we can hope a single world together;
Warm up the soul...

- Boys, I swear I've been there!


8. Holy Land

We were born in a Golden Age
Beyond the creed
Blown with the winds to meet
The ones who creep
And pray

Unshod feet traces on fresh sand
A map unfold
Spreading out knowledge,
Magic and love
And then

Carried by wooden gods
We leave towards the sky
Gushed out the holy blood
From those who die
To bless

Ooh, and dance...
Ooh, still dance...

Someone has sent
Somebody here
To bring an age
Long disappeared

Holy Land -
Throw you scars on me!
My soul just tends to be
Your friend.

Holy Land - Holy Land around
Holy Land - Holy land is all...

Someone has sent
Somebody here
To bring an age
Long disappeared

Holy Land -
Show your signs to me!
'Cause I'm still here to see
Your face.


9. Jam

[Instrumental]



10. Wuthering Heights

[Originally performed by Kate Bush]

Out on the wiley, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green
You had a temper, like my jealousy
Too hot, too greedy
How could you leave me?
When I needed to possess you
I hated you, I loved you too

Bad dreams in the night
They told me I was going to lose the fight
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights.

Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy come home
I'm so cold, let me in-a-your window

Oh it gets dark, it gets lonely
On the other side from you
I pine a lot, I find the lot
Falls through without you
I'm coming back love, cruel Heathcliff
My only one dream, my only master

Too long I roam in the night
I'm coming back to his side to put it right
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights

Oh let me have it, let me grab your soul away
Oh let me have it, let me grab your soul away
You know it's me, Cathy


11. Chega De Saudade

Vai minha tristeza
E diz a ela que sem ela não pode ser,
Diz-lhe numa prece
Que ela regresse
Porque não posso mais sofrer.
Chega de saudade,
A realidade é que sem ela
Não há paz, Não há beleza,
É só tristeza e a melancolia
Que não sai de mim,
Não sai de mim,
Não sai.
Mas, se ela voltar,
Se ela voltar que coisa linda!
Que coisa louca!
Pois há menos peixinhos a nadar no mar
Do que os beijinhos
Que eu darei na sua boca.
Dentro dos meus braços, os abraços
Hão de ser milhões de abraços
Apertado assim, colado assim, calada assim,
Abraços e beijinhos e carinhos sem ter fim,
Que é pra acabar com esse negócio
De viver longe de mim.
Não quero mais esse negócio
De você viver assim,
Vamos deixar esse negócio
De você viver sem mim...


12. Never Understand

White gold, a morning came
Sunny cold, reflecting light
Unknown songs

Fresh water gush licks the lime
Sprinkling crowns of silence
The face wet from the moistened dew

Wind takes the sight
Around the meadow
Playing kindly

Silver dropped wine
That flows inside
a sleeping hand...

Desperation fills the air
(In your heart lies the dust of the anger)
Madness knocking on my back
(Chiming bells have announced the new day)

My courage lies someplace
where time forgot to send me
(now where are you going?)
(now where are you going now?)
Someday they'll mark your sins
like torture on your back

I wonder why
My mind is tight
Like stormy weather
And so it seems
That little steps
would take forever

Oh, never understand...
We're like mad horses
heading for the bend
This place I'm standing here
Made it on my own
Moored my life to never let it go...

I wonder why
My mind is tight
Like stormy weather
And so it seems
That little steps
would take forever

Never understand...
We're like mad horses
heading for the bend
This place I'm standing here
Made it on my own
Moored my life to never let it go...

All my life I'll be the way
I won't forget
All my life is never understand


13. Wasted Years

[Originally performed by Iron Maiden]

From the coast of gold, across the seven seas
I'm travellin' on, far and wide
But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do,
it isn't me but someone else

I close my eyes, and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is,
you never miss it 'til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there
and will be 'til my dying day

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching
for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years

Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain, so easily
When you can't find the words to say
it's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry
and throw my hands up to the sky

2. Nova Era

Somehow I know
The things are gonna change
New boundaries on the way
Like never before
Find a meaning to your life
Healing whispers of the angels
Bring the sunrise again

New day shines, fallen angels will arise
Nova Era brings the ashes back to life
All over now, sores in pain and awful lies
Angels will arise
Back to life!

Fresh winds of hope
Has taken us ahead
Forever is a place

No way to limit our goals
You'll find a reason to believe
Facing Nova Era

And forever you may find a better time
Nova Era bring the angels back to life... Life!


3. Millennium Sun

An eagle breaks the silence
And overflies the field
My eyes will try to follow
Till it vanishes away

Like candles in the darkness
We fight against the wind
Devotion to your idols
Soon will overthrow the king

Out of order
Taming borders
Tearing down the fences
On and on and after all
The century has gone
Racism jumble
Turbulence
My eyes believe we have gone to the end

Ordinary Earth
Sailing through the space

Population alienation
Losing all affection
Calling on to heaven's hope
To watch for my protection
Out of luck
Potential stuck
Remote controlled
By the T.V. again

Carries human souls
Lead us the journey of our fate
So come millennium sun
Won't you show us the way
Future's begun
So words from my mouth come
Whispering for your return

Pictures a sunset on the lake
Mirrors of crystal your portrait
Walking on this field while I wait

So come millennium sun
Won't you show us the way
Future's begun
So words come from my mouth
Whispering for your return
Show us the future's began
Burning millennium sun


4. Acid Rain

When the world had a tragic fate
We were draining the poisoned sea
Though the scenes were indeed too sad
Only prayers were taking lead

Oh! Just some of us survived
At least a discent woman and a man
Wide awake! Am I alone in this place
Someone hear me ? my only hope!

The Acid Rain is burning
Right into your eyes
Again your dreams may loose the glow
Allow the sorrow of your thoughts to meet sunrise
And shall the hopefull words
Bring love inside your heart

So the world knew a tragic fate
We were draining the deadly sea
And the scenes were indeed too sad
Only prayers were taking lead

The Acid Rain is burning your eyes!


5. Heroes Of Sand

Sealing light
Nothing to see
Like a miracle life
Starts with the pain
Forever this will be

Close my eyes
Thunders won't cease
Crawling down to the edge
I break down and weep
Tears on the river deep
Oh! Back to the sea

Shout loud
Moving ahead
Ride the horses of justice
Virtues of men, yawns!

Down and out
Losing my head
Like a dream you're returning
Back from the dead-awake!
Shadows will fade some day
All the heroes go down
Shed their blood on the land
Dreaming somehow
The divine will now stand
Heroes go down
With their hearts in their hands
Building their castles on the sand

Haunted by the heavy clouds
Thunder scaring away
Howling like a mountain wolf
Warriors are leading the way


6. Unholy Wars

A lethal bolt pierces the air
Like a falling star
Young eyes are observing in the darkness
His stares reflecting fright
And scared he's struggling hard
To go back

Uneasy warders guard
The jail on quiet nights
Young eyes contemplating somewhere to hide
Mankind will soon learn
That the end has come in time

Dividing lands, retracing
All the borders will collide
Revealing ages when the absence
Of forgiveness rules our lives

Home how I go
My badge is wearing out
Written on the sand
Words to reconcile - unholy wars

Forgive us our father
For we have sinned
Blinded by pride
We know not what we do
Thy kingdom will be done
By holy wars

The battle is over
But the war still rages on!
[Bridge]
[Chorus]


7. Rebirth

Cooling breeze from a summer day
Hearing echoes from your heart
Learning how to recompose the words
Let time just fly

Joyfull sea-gulls roaming on the shore
Not a single note would sound
Raise my head after I dry my face
Let time just fly

Recalling, retreating
Returning, retrieving
A small talk your missing
More clever but older now

A leader, a learner
A lawful beginner
A lodger of lunacy
So lucid in a jungle
A helper, a sinner
A scarecrow's agonyzing smile

Oh! Minutes go round and round
Inside my head
Oh! My chest will now explode
Falling into pieces
Rain breaks on the ground-blood!

One minute forever
A sinner regretting
My vulgar misery ends

(And I) ride the winds of a brand new day
High where mountain's stand
Found my hope and pride again
Rebirth of a man

Time to fly...


8. Judgement Day

Inside the cage of your mind
Waiting for the day
Just a victim of the guilt
Living in despair

Out on your own in the dark
Sinners meet the saints
Bloody river overflows
You don't really care

Setting on fire
Your own freedom
Played the hardest game
Now you will burn
Your eternal flame

Even the brave won't deny
Evil warns again
And your conscience isn't safe
Driving you insane

Playing with fire
Put your freedom
Through the hardest test
Don't blame the scare
On your final day

One last minute passes by your soul
Just one minute lost in the horizon
You will face the judgement day
(Scream your voice free to the air)
Waiting for the judgement day

One last minute passes by your soul
Just one minute more in the horizon
One more minute passes by your eyes
Just one minute less in the horizon

Then you face the judgement day
(Scream your voice free to the air)
There'll no more time to pray
(Sweat in pain you are afraid)
We all face the judgement day


9. Running Alone

When the brave fought
On the land of freedom for the men
Now the bells of hope are ringing
Angels cry again

The goddess of wind was mad, oh no!
Spreading the fire
Rushing our destiny (and) from now
Dividing us all.
Visions of steady land
Cheering the sight
Orders to wait until the night

Answer me,
What happened to your life?
Answer me, what do you hide?

The storm made us angry, I don't know!
Spreading the fear
Old friends like enemies, be strong!
And hide all your tears
Revolting the high command
Don't let it drown
Captain took off before the dawn.

Answer me,
What happened to your life?
Answer me, what do you hide?
Can't you see
Salvation without fight?
Can't you see it?
That you are blind

Under the sun
In a solitary world
I am running alone
Scars on my face
Weary hands from digging dirt
I was dying all alone

Am running?
Where am I?
Where has everyone gone this time?
Left my future far behind
I am nothing but the sole survivor

Under the sun I still see this world burning
Scars on my face shows the eyes of a man running


10. Visions Prelude

[Adapted from Chopin]
[Op. 24 Prelude in C minor]

Cold wind, sad moonrise
Dark clouds in the sky
Storm ends the mourning time
Howling in the night

Vision of the land
After the horrid end
We build again from the start
Holy lenient heart

A treasure of the land
Torments have brought the end
We build again from the start
Holy lenient heart

Visions come from the sea
Oceans bring to me
I reach the sand with a kiss
Treasures bristling from a bliss


11. Bleeding Heart

Now I know that the end comes
You knew since the beginning
Didn't want to believe it's true
You are alone again
My soul will be with you

Why's the clock even running
If my world isn't turning?
Hear your voice in the doorway wind
You are alone again
I'm only waiting

You tear into pieces my heart
before you leave with no repentance
I cried to you, my tears turn into blood
I'm ready to surrender
You say that I take it too hard
And all I ask is comprehension
Bring back to you
A piece of my broken heart
I'm ready to surrender

I remember the moments
Life was short for the romance
Like a rose it will fade away
I'm leaving everything

No regrets, war is over
The return of a soldier
Put my hands on my bleeding heart
I'm leaving all behind
No longer waiting

I've waited for so long!
